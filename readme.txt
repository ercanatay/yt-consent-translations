== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin require YOOtheme Pro? =

Yes, this plugin is designed specifically for translating the YOOtheme Pro 5 Consent Manager. It won't have any effect without YOOtheme Pro installed.

= Can I add my own custom language? =

Yes! Simply select any language preset and modify the texts to your needs. Your custom translations will override the preset values.

= Does it work with multilingual plugins? =

The plugin stores translations per WordPress installation. For true multilingual support with WPML or Polylang, you may need to configure the plugin separately for each language or use the multilingual plugin's string translation feature.

= How do I backup my translations? =

Use the Export button to download a JSON file of your current settings. You can Import this file later to restore your translations.

= My translations are not showing up =

1. Make sure the plugin is enabled (check the toggle in settings)
2. Clear any caching plugins
3. Clear your browser cache
4. Make sure you're using YOOtheme Pro 5 with the Consent Manager enabled

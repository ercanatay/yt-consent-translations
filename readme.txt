== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin require YOOtheme Pro? =

Yes, this plugin is designed specifically for translating the YOOtheme Pro 5 Consent Manager. It won't have any effect without YOOtheme Pro installed.

= Can I add my own custom language? =

Yes! Simply select any language preset and modify the texts to your needs. Your custom translations will override the preset values.

= Does it work with multilingual plugins? =

The plugin supports locale-scoped settings (for example `en_US`, `tr_TR`) so you can maintain different overrides per locale while still using shared language presets.

= How do I backup my translations? =

Use the Export button to download a JSON file of your current settings. You can Import this file later to restore your translations.

= How does the updater panel work? =

Enable periodic checks from plugin settings. The plugin reads WordPress core update metadata every 12 hours and shows current update status in the updater panel. Use "Check Now" for an immediate refresh.

= My translations are not showing up =

1. Make sure the plugin is enabled (check the toggle in settings)
2. Clear any caching plugins
3. Clear your browser cache
4. Make sure you're using YOOtheme Pro 5 with the Consent Manager enabled

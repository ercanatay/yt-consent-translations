## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-21

### Changed
- **Major Refactoring**: Moved all translations from hardcoded PHP to external JSON files
- Each language now has its own `languages/{code}.json` file (36 files)
- Implemented lazy loading - only requested language is loaded into memory
- Per-language caching instead of loading all translations at once

### Performance
- Reduced memory usage by ~95% on typical requests
- Translations are loaded on-demand instead of all at once
- Added `clear_cache()` method for memory management

### Code Quality
- Separation of concerns: data (JSON) separated from logic (PHP)
- Easier to maintain and update individual language files
- Better code organization following best practices
